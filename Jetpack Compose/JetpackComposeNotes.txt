    - we can have row data to function which annotatate with @Preview to get lookup of our view 
    - The function which annotate with @Preview should not take any param otherwise you get error at @Preview
    - We can have multiple function with Annotate with @Preview 
    - @Preview annotate method get internally called, we dont need to explicitly call it
